    "# PSEUDOCODE / DETAILED PLAN:\n",
    "# 1. Import the target function using an absolute import:\n",
    "#      from apprentissage.quiSeraLeVainqueur import quiSeraLeVainqueur\n",
    "# 2. Locate the pokedex.csv file from the repository to obtain a list of Pokemon names.\n",
    "#    - Try common relative locations: \"./apprentissage/data/pokedex.csv\", \"./data/pokedex.csv\"\n",
    "#    - Read the CSV header and pick a reasonable text column to extract names (try common headers).\n",
    "#    - Fall back to reading the second column of the CSV if header names are unknown.\n",
    "# 3. Limit the number of Pokemon to a small N (configurable, e.g. 8) to keep test runtime short.\n",
    "# 4. Generate all unordered pairs of distinct Pokemon from that list (combinations).\n",
    "# 5. For each pair (A, B), call quiSeraLeVainqueur in a flexible way:\n",
    "#    - Try quiSeraLeVainqueur(A, B)\n",
    "#    - If TypeError, try quiSeraLeVainqueur([A, B]) or quiSeraLeVainqueur(A, B, model_path) if model arg exists\n",
    "#    - If the function raises any unexpected exception, fail the test with clear diagnostics.\n",
    "# 6. Collect the winners into a tally mapping winner -> count.\n",
    "# 7. Assert the following test conditions:\n",
    "#    - No unexpected exceptions occurred while querying all pairs.\n",
    "#    - The number of results equals the number of pairs.\n",
    "#    - Every reported winner is one of the two participants for that match (or at least a non-empty string).\n",
    "#    - There is at least one winner (top count >= 1).\n",
    "# 8. Print a short summary of the top winners to the notebook output for inspection.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The resulting notebook cell(s) are runnable as tests: they will raise AssertionError on failure.\n",
